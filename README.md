# FL clients heterogeneity

## Overview

Repository to explore and quantify the heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learing.
There seem to be at least two questions of interest:

1. How to measure heterogeneity between silos within a dataset.
2. How to compare heterogeneity between datasets.

There are at least two kinds of heterogeneity metrics: 
1. statistical metrics *(based primarily on the datasets)*
2. optimization metrics *(based on quantities that appear throughout the optimization process, once a loss/predictive model has been defined)*

## Code structure

The metrics are systematically computed for:
1. both iid and non-iid settings
2. w.r.t. the centralized client (the client that hold the full dataset) and between clients.

Main classes:

1. Client. Attributes: the dataset and its projection, the label, the distribution X, Y, X|Y and Y|X.
2. ClientsNetwork. Attributes: all clients, the centralized client.
3. Distance. Save the distance between clients and with the central client fo the iid and non-iid case.
4. DistanceForSeveralRuns. Attributes: list of distance computed with different dataset splits.
5. StatisticalMetrics. Attributes: the distances computed over several runs for each kinf od distribution.
